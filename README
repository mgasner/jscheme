This is an exceedingly na√Øve "teach yourself to program in fixnum days" kind of exercise. The goal is to write first an in-browser REPL for R5RS Scheme and then a compiler from R5RS to JavaScript.

The initial, horrific, fumbling stages have been omitted.

This project is clearly derivative and will be building off of models provided by SICP, Norvig's lis.py, Nils Holm's S9fES, Dmitri Soshnikov's CoffeeScript metacircular interpreter, and Abdulaziz Ghuloum's compilers tutorial (to start).
